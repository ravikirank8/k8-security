how linux ❑ Password based authentication disabled
The best way to disable password-based authentication on Linux is to edit the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file.
Look for the line that says “PasswordAuthentication yes” and change it to “PasswordAuthentication no”. 
Then save the file and restart the ssh service with the command “service ssh restart”. This will disable password-based authentication for all users.

how to set SSH Key based authentication on linux

1. Generate a SSH Key

The first step to setting up SSH key based authentication is to generate a SSH key. This can be done by running the ssh-keygen command in a terminal window.

2. Copy the Public Key

Once the SSH key is generated, you need to copy the public key to the server you wish to access. This can be done using the ssh-copy-id command. 
This command will copy the public key to the server and set the appropriate file permissions.

3. Configure the Server

The final step is to configure the server to use the SSH key for authentication. This can be done by editing the sshd_config file in the /etc/ssh directory.
You need to set the PasswordAuthentication to no and PubkeyAuthentication to yes. Once this is done, you can restart the sshd service to apply the changes.

Now you can try to connect to the server using the SSH key. If everything is configured correctly, you should be able to access the server without 
needing to enter a password.
